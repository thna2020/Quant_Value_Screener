# Quantitative Value Screener

This project is on **value investing**, popularized by Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, Seth Glarman. Value investing refers to investing in stocks that are being traded below their perceived intrinsic value.

The core concept of our algorithmic value investing strategy is **multiples**, which is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by some measure of the company's worth such as earnings and assets. Common multiples in value investing are:
- Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio = Share price / Earnings per share
- Price-to-book-value (P/B) ratio = Market price per share / Book value per share
- Price-to-free-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio = Share price / Cash flow per share
-- The P/CF ratio measures how much cash a company generates relative to its stock price.
